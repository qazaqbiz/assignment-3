            <h2>Official Rules of Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
            <p>Rock Paper Scissors is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no
                tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree
                of power and will lead to an outcome.</p>
            <h3>Why is Rock Paper Scissors played?</h3>
            <p>This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the world. Apart from being a game
                played to pass time, the game is usually played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is
                similar in that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing straws. There is no
                room for cheating or for knowing what the other person is going to do so the results are usually very
                satisfying with no room for fighting or error.</p>

            <h3>What are the rules of RPS?</h3>
            <p>Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
                The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game;
                rock,
                paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:</p>
            <ul type="none">
                <li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
                <li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
                <li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
            </ul>
